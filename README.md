# Random Minecraft Education Servers

**Disclaimer:** This project was not made to harm Mojang, Minecraft Education Edition or any of its users. 
Rather, I made this for something I can code on my own time.

Join random Minecraft Education Servers in your school board, by brute-forcing every possible combination of server codes!

Using as many threads as possible, this program will go through 73440 different combinations of server codes like the ones 
you enter when you join a server, and finds which codes exist.

Fastest time on my gaming PC: **21 minutes** (all code combinations searched!)

**Note: You'll only find codes that you can join from your organization/school board.**
